# Oh Rats! - NFT collection

The year is 2049, and the world as we knew it has crumbled under the tiny feet of our new rulers - the rats. The Oh Rats! NFT collection immortalizes the pivotal moments of the rodent revolution and the establishment of the Rat Dynasty. This series of digital artifacts captures the essence of our post-takeover world, where humanity lives in the shadows of the whiskered conquerors.
